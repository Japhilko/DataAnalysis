# Data Analysis

This is a synopsis on my findings and activities on data analysis and [data science](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/portfolio/Misc/DataScience.md).

- [Here](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/tree/master/Presentations) you can see some of my presentations. 


# Toolsets

## R-Project

e.g. tidyverse, caret,  MLmetrics

## Python




# Methods - Maths and Statistics

Methods and statistics that can be used for statistical learning and machine learning.

## [Empirical Data Analysis](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Multivariate%20Analysis/EmpiricalDataAnalysis.md)

- [Statistical Classification](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Multivariate%20Analysis/ClusterAnalysis.md)

- [Text Mining](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/TextAnalytics/Text%20Mining%20Wikipedia.Rmd)

## [Machine Learning](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/tree/master/Machine%20Learning)

- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/DecisionTrees.md)

- [Analysing Coherences](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Coherences/Measures%20for%20Coherences.Rmd)

- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Regression/SimpleLinearRegression.Rmd)

- [Non parametric regression](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/tree/master/npRegression)

# Technology and Programming

- [Programming with R](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/tree/master/portfolio/R)

- [Programming with Python](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/tree/master/portfolio/python)

- [The Julia Language](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/portfolio/Julia/JuliaLanguage.Rmd)

- [Databases](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/portfolio/Databases/Databases.md)

## Parallelisation

Parallelisation can be necessary due to four reasons:

- not enough [memory size](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.2/topics/memory.size#:~:text=The%20minimum%20is%20currently%2032Mb,the%20limit%20is%20currently%208Tb.)


# Getting Data

- [Twitter](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/TextAnalytics/TextMining_Twitter.Rmd)

- [Wikipedia](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/data/Wikidata.Rmd)

- [Openstreetmap](https://github.com/Japhilko/DataAnalysis/blob/master/UseCases/OSM_GermanCities.md)
